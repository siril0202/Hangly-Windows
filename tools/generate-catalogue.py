"""Generate the C# charm catalogue from the Swift source.

The catalogue is a hundred and sixty entries of pure data — identity, mass, radius, palette,
sound and how the artwork divides into beads. Transcribing that by hand is that many
chances to mistype a number that no compiler would catch and only a screenshot would,
so it is read out of `reference/swift/` instead and written as C#.

Re-runnable on purpose. When the Swift changes, run this rather than editing the
generated file; the header says so to whoever opens it next.
