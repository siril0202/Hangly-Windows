/// <summary>Holds the process open while Hangly has no XAML window on screen.</summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <b>WinUI ends the process when its last window closes.</b> Hangly usually has none —
/// the charm is a plain Win32 layered window and the tray is a message-only one — so for
/// most of its life there is no window to close and nothing to end. The moment one does
/// exist and then goes away, the count falls from one to zero and WinUI shuts everything
/// down.
///
/// <para><b>Which is exactly what first-run did.</b> The welcome card was the only XAML
/// window in the process; pressing <i>Get started</i> closed it, WinUI ended the app, and
/// the charm and the tray icon went with it. Testers had to find Hangly again and start it
/// a second time before it did anything, which reads as the installer having failed.
/// Measured on a clean profile: <c>welcome card completed</c> in the log, then no
/// process.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The fix is to let the onboarding windows hide rather than close</b>, which is
/// what <see cref="Customize.CustomizeWindow"/> already does. A window that is hidden has
/// not closed, so the count never reaches zero, and the window is released for real when
/// the app quits.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why not one permanent window that is never shown.</b> That was the first fix
/// and it worked, and it was measured: an empty <c>Window</c> costs about twelve megabytes
/// of working set and two hundred handles, on <em>every</em> launch, to solve a problem
/// that only exists on the few launches where an onboarding card appears. Hiding the card
/// that is already there costs nothing on any other launch.</para>
