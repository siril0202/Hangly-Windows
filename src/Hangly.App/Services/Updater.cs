/// <para><b>One channel per architecture.</b> An ARM64 machine must never be offered an

/// <c>releases.win-arm64.json</c> or <c>releases.win-x64.json</c>, chosen here rather
/// than by whatever the server happens to serve.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Nothing is sent.</b> A check is a GET for a static file. There is no server
/// component and no identifier — the same promise the macOS build's appcast makes, and

///
/// <para><b>Silent.</b> A found update is downloaded in the background and installed while
/// the person is away — locked, or a screen saver up (<see cref="Core.Lifecycle.UpdateTiming"/>)
/// — or as Hangly quits, or the next time it starts, whichever comes first. Nothing asks
/// and nothing is shown while it happens; the new version greets them with its release
/// notes when they return. The About page and the tray can still install one at once.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Every failure is quiet.</b> A machine with no network, a feed that has not
/// been published yet, and a release that will not parse are all the same answer: there
/// is no update today. None of them is worth interrupting someone over, and none of them
