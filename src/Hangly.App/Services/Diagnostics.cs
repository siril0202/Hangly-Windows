/// <b>Why this exists.</b> Hangly has no main window, no taskbar button and no console:
/// it is a tray icon and a transparent overlay. When it fails during startup there is
/// therefore nothing at all to see — no dialog, no output, no window that closes. The
/// first report from a real machine was exactly that, "no message, no response", which is
/// indistinguishable from the app not having been launched.
///
/// <para>So the app writes a line per startup step to a file it always knows the path of,
/// and installs handlers that catch what would otherwise be a silent exit. The last line
/// in the file is the step that failed. That turns "nothing happened" into an address.</para>
///
/// <para>Logging is best-effort and never throws: a diagnostic that can take the app down
/// is worse than no diagnostic. Every write is wrapped, and a failed write is dropped.</para>
