/// <summary>Accepts files dropped onto the overlay window.</summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <b>Why a real drop target and not <c>WM_DROPFILES</c>.</b> The shell's simple path
/// tells you a file arrived and nothing else — no enter, no leave, no chance to say
/// whether the thing being dragged is even wanted. macOS reacts while a file is held over
/// the charm and reports it separately from the drop, which is what <c>airdrop_drag_entered</c>
/// is for, so the same three moments have to exist here.
///
/// <para><b>The charm is the drop target because the charm is already the hit area.</b>
/// The overlay is click-through everywhere except the charm's grab disc, and a window
/// with <c>WS_EX_TRANSPARENT</c> receives no drops at all — the drag passes through to
/// whatever is behind it. So the same toggle that lets the charm be picked up is what
/// makes it catch a file, and nothing else about the overlay has to change. The macOS
/// documentation describes exactly this: "the charm's hit disc is already the only part
/// of the overlay that takes the mouse, so it doubles as the drop target with no change
/// to click-through elsewhere".</para>
///
/// <para>Only one file is taken from a drop of several. An import replaces one charm, and
/// there is no sensible reading of four files landing on one place.</para>
/// </remarks>
