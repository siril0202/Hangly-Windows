/// <c>MenuBarExtra</c> scene, and it buys the same three things that scene did: native
/// appearance, keyboard navigation and screen-reader support, because the menu really is
/// the system's own menu rather than a borderless window pretending to be one.
///
/// <para>The menu is rebuilt from the callback on every right-click rather than held and
/// mutated. It is built a few times a day at most, it is always read immediately after
/// it is built, and rebuilding is what makes a checkmark that disagrees with the settings
