/// <summary>The creator credit, built once and used by every window that shows one.</summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <b>One factory rather than seven copies.</b> The credit appears in the navigation
/// pane, on the About page and on the Enjoying Hangly card, and the whole point of it is
/// that it reads as one voice in each. Four hand-written copies
/// drift: one gets bolder, one loses the handle, one links somewhere slightly different.
///
/// <para><b>Quiet by construction.</b> "Created by" is caption-sized and dimmed; only the
/// handle is emphasised, and only by being a link rather than by being bold. Nothing here
/// asks for anything: support is offered by the cards' own buttons.</para>
///
/// <para>The About page's card is written in the markup instead, because it is a laid-out
/// panel rather than a line of text and XAML is where the rest of that page lives.</para>
