/// <b>Why this exists instead of a WinUI window.</b> The overlay has to be transparent
/// per pixel: the rope is a few thin strokes and a charm, and everything around them has
/// to be the desktop. A WinUI 3 window cannot do that. Its HWND is created without
/// <c>WS_EX_NOREDIRECTIONBITMAP</c>, so it owns an opaque redirection surface that no
/// XAML property can remove — a null background, a null <c>SystemBackdrop</c> and an
/// extended glass frame all paint onto that surface rather than replacing it, and the
/// window composites as a white rectangle with a perfectly correct rope inside it.
/// That was observed, not assumed.
///
/// <para><b>Two ways to get pixels onto it, tried in order.</b> Both give per-pixel alpha.
///
/// <list type="number">
/// <item><b>DirectComposition</b>, preferred. The window has no redirection surface; a
/// Win2D swap chain is its content, and a frame goes from Win2D to the compositor without
/// leaving the GPU. Still a layered window, with its alpha fixed at opaque through
/// <c>SetLayeredWindowAttributes</c>, because layered plus <c>WS_EX_TRANSPARENT</c> is
/// what makes a window click-through.</item>
/// <item><b><c>UpdateLayeredWindow</c></b>, the fallback: each frame rendered into a
/// <c>CanvasRenderTarget</c>, read back to system memory and handed to GDI.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// The second was the only path until it was profiled. The read-back was 5.9 ms of the
/// 7.9 ms a frame cost at 1431×893 on the ARM64 test machine — a GPU stall, mostly fixed
/// cost, so reading back only the changed part barely helped — and the rope draws every
/// frame for the forty-odd seconds it takes to settle after a launch, a nudge or a drag:
/// about a fifth of a core, for as long as anything moves. The composition path is
/// tried at creation, and anything it cannot do sends the window back to the first way,
/// recreated from scratch, with the reason in the log.</para>
///
/// <para>The surface is premultiplied BGRA because that is what
/// <c>UpdateLayeredWindow</c> blends and what Win2D renders natively. No conversion
/// happens anywhere between the drawing session and the desktop.</para>
