/// <summary>The overlay: one window, one rope, no chrome.</summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <b>Why this is not a WinUI window any more.</b> It was one, and it drew a correct rope
/// inside an opaque white rectangle on every machine it was run on. A WinUI 3 window owns
/// a redirection surface created with its HWND, and nothing XAML exposes — a null
/// background, a null <c>SystemBackdrop</c>, <c>DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea</c> — replaces
/// that surface; they all paint onto it. The Windows App SDK this builds against has no
/// <c>TransparentBackdrop</c> to ask for instead. So the overlay owns a plain Win32
/// layered window and paints it itself; see <see cref="LayeredOverlaySurface"/>.
///
/// <para><b>One thread owns everything.</b> The window is created on a dedicated thread
/// which then pumps its messages, steps the solver and presents each frame. That is not
/// an optimisation — a window whose thread never pumps is marked unresponsive and
/// replaced by a ghost, and the frame loop has to live wherever the window does. Settings
/// arriving from the tray are handed over as a single volatile reference and picked up at
/// the top of a frame, which is the whole of the cross-thread surface.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Click-through is toggled, not partial.</b> Windows decides hit-testing per
/// window, exactly as AppKit does, so <c>WS_EX_TRANSPARENT</c> is turned on and off once
/// per frame according to whether the cursor is inside the charm's grab radius. The
/// write is guarded on change: setting a window style unconditionally at 120 Hz talks to
/// the window manager often enough to keep a settled overlay measurably busy, which is
/// the same finding the macOS build recorded against <c>ignoresMouseEvents</c>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Input is polled.</b> <see cref="NativeMethods.GetCursorPos"/> and
/// <see cref="NativeMethods.GetAsyncKeyState"/> are read on the same tick that steps the
/// physics. A click-through window receives no mouse messages by definition, so there is
/// nothing to handle; polling is what lets the charm notice the cursor arriving without
/// installing a global hook.</para>
