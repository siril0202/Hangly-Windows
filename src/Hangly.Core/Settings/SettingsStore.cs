/// no-op assignment writes nothing, which matters because the overlay's own reactions
/// are driven off <see cref="Changed"/>.

/// <para>The file path is injected rather than discovered, which is what lets the tests

/// <para>The macOS original keeps this document in <c>UserDefaults</c>. Windows has no
/// equivalent worth using — the registry is the wrong shape for a nested document — so it
/// is one JSON file, written atomically through a temporary file so that a crash mid-write
/// cannot leave a half-document behind. It lives in <b>roaming</b> app data, for the
/// reason on <see cref="DefaultPath"/>: the local folder is where Velopack installs the
/// application, and installing over an existing copy clears it.</para>
