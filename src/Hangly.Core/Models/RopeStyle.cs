/// Every field is a multiplier on, or a replacement for, a value the solver already
/// had. None of them is a new force, a spring or a second integrator: the rope stays
/// the same twenty-segment Verlet chain, solved the same way, so a style cannot make
/// it unstable and cannot make it non-deterministic.
///
/// <para><b>Why there is no mass here.</b> The obvious way to make a gold chain feel
/// heavy is to give the rope's nodes more mass, and in this solver that does close to
/// nothing. Gravity is applied as a positional delta of <c>gravity × dt²</c>, which is
/// mass-independent; damping scales a displacement, which is mass-independent; and a
/// distance constraint splits its correction by the <em>ratio</em> of the two nodes'
/// inverse masses, which is unchanged when every node is scaled together. Multiplying
/// every rope node's mass by four is very nearly the identity function.</para>
///
/// <para>So weight is expressed the way it is actually perceived instead: a heavy
/// thing accelerates slowly, swings with a long period and keeps going. That is
/// <see cref="GravityScale"/> and <see cref="Damping"/>. Stiffness is
/// <see cref="MaxStretchRatio"/> and the pass budgets. The one place a literal mass
/// still changes the picture is the single link between the last rope node and the
/// charm, because there the ratio genuinely differs: that is
/// <see cref="CharmMassScale"/>.</para>
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="GravityScale">
/// Multiplier on <see cref="Physics.RopeConfiguration.Gravity"/>. The only knob in a
/// pendulum that changes its period, which goes as <c>1 / sqrt(gravityScale)</c>. It
/// does not change where the rope hangs at rest — straight down is straight down at
/// any gravity — so a style change never moves the charm, only how it travels.
/// </param>
/// <param name="Damping">
/// Replaces <see cref="Physics.RopeConfiguration.Damping"/>. Applied per fixed step at
/// 240 Hz, so small differences compound quickly: 0.999 keeps 79% of a swing's motion
/// over a second where 0.9955 keeps 34%.
/// </param>
/// <param name="MaxStretchRatio">
/// Replaces <see cref="Physics.RopeConfiguration.MaxStretchRatio"/>. A chain is
/// inextensible and a thread is not.
/// </param>
/// <param name="ConstraintIterations">
/// Replaces <see cref="Physics.RopeConfiguration.ConstraintIterations"/>. A cap rather
/// than a fixed cost — relaxation exits as soon as it converges — so a stiffer style
/// pays for its extra passes only on the frames that need them.
/// </param>
/// <param name="StretchPasses">
/// Replaces <see cref="Physics.RopeConfiguration.StretchPasses"/>. Tracks the
/// iteration budget: a tighter ceiling takes more sweeps to satisfy.
/// </param>
/// <param name="CharmMassScale">
/// Multiplier on the charm's mass, which sets the inverse-mass ratio of the one link
/// that has a ratio worth changing. Above one the charm holds its line and the rope
/// bends around it; below one the charm is flicked about by the cord.
