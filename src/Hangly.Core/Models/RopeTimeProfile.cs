/// <remarks>
/// The whole design goal in one sentence: someone should think <em>the rope feels a
/// little different today</em>, never <em>this is a different rope</em>. That rules
/// out most of what could have been changed. Gravity is untouched, because it is the
/// only knob in a pendulum that alters its period, and a changed period is precisely
/// what would read as a different rope. So is the length, the segment count and the
/// stretch ceiling. What changes is how long motion <em>persists</em> — felt rather
/// than seen, and the one property of a swing a person could not name if asked but
/// would notice if it were wrong.
///
/// <para><see cref="Afternoon"/> is the identity. Every one of its scales is exactly
/// one, so an afternoon rope is the rope that shipped, to the last bit.</para>

/// <summary>What a time of day does to the solver.</summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Three scales, and not one of them is an absolute value. That is deliberate: the
/// rope already has nine styles with damping four times apart, and a profile that
/// wrote a fixed number would flatten them into each other — a leather rope at night
/// would settle at the same rate as a neon one. Scaling what each style already does
/// keeps leather the quick one and makes night the quicker version of whatever the
/// rope happens to be made of.
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="EnergyLossScale">
/// Multiplier on how fast the rope loses energy — that is, on <c>1 - damping</c>
/// rather than on damping itself. The right quantity to scale: damping is a number
/// just under one, and the interesting part is the sliver below it. Halving
/// <em>that</em> halves the rate a swing dies away at, whatever the style set it to,
/// where halving the damping itself would stop the rope dead.
/// </param>
/// <param name="ReleaseAngleScale">
/// Multiplier on the angle the rope is released at when it first appears. The
/// morning's greeting is a slightly wider swing; the night's a narrower one. Costs
/// nothing, because it happens once.
/// </param>
/// <param name="RestSpeedScale">
/// Multiplier on the speed below which the rope counts as still. Above one the rope
/// decides it has finished sooner — the same thing a calmer evening does to a person.
