/// Everything here is data read out of the Swift catalogue by
/// <c>tools/generate-catalogue.py</c>. What is <b>not</b> here is the knot inset and the
/// beads: both are measured from the artwork by <see cref="CharmArtworkSplitter"/>
/// rather than stated, because the artwork is where the designer put them and a number
/// typed beside it is a number that can disagree with the picture.
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="Id">
/// The macOS <c>CharmKind</c> raw value, unchanged. It is what a settings file and an
/// analytics event name the charm by, so the two platforms have to agree on it exactly.

/// Which solid part the charm itself begins at. Equal to <paramref name="BeadCount"/>

/// case the parts between are dropped and the simulated cord replaces them.
/// </param>
/// <param name="CordDrawn">
/// The artwork draws a cord of its own above a charm with no beads, which the simulated
/// cord replaces — Spider-Man swinging from his web line.
