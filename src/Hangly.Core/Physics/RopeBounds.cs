/// <remarks>
/// <b>Why it exists.</b> The overlay's canvas is sized for the whole swing, and at 200% it
/// is 1431×893 pixels; the rope and its charms cover a strip of it. A layered window
/// hands every frame to Windows from system memory, so every frame used to be read back
/// from the GPU in full — 5.9 ms of the 7.9 a frame cost, measured, for pixels that were
/// transparent before and after. Reading back only what changed is most of the saving.
///
/// <para><b>Conservative on purpose.</b> A rectangle too small leaves a trail of the last
/// frame on the desktop; one too large costs a few more bytes. So each part is padded for
/// the widest thing drawn around it: a charm's artwork is a square rotated by the cord,
/// so it reaches √2 of its radius, and its drop shadow and ambient glow reach further
/// still — the glow to <see cref="RopeConfiguration.Layout.CharmHaloExtent"/> radii, the
/// shadow to about 1.8. <see cref="CharmReach"/> covers both with margin.</para>
