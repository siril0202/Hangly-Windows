/// The step order is deliberate and is what makes the rope both stable and stiff:
/// <list type="number">
/// <item><b>Pin the anchor.</b> Done first so a moved anchor drags the rope this step
/// rather than next, which is what makes a window resize look physical.</item>
/// <item><b>Integrate.</b> Each free node moves by its own damped displacement plus
/// gravity. No forces, no velocity array: Verlet infers velocity from history.</item>
/// <item><b>Drive the held node.</b> A dragged node is written directly, with its
/// history set so that its implied velocity matches the cursor's.</item>
/// <item><b>Relax constraints.</b> Gauss-Seidel passes pull each link back to its rest
/// length. Later passes see the corrections of earlier ones, so convergence is fast.</item>
/// <item><b>Clamp stretch.</b> A final hard pass guarantees no link exceeds its limit
/// even if relaxation has not fully converged.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// <para>Time advances in fixed slices. The display's refresh rate only decides how
